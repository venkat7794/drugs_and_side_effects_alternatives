## Introduction
The **Drugs and Side Effects Alternatives Project** is an initiative aimed at analyzing pharmaceutical drugs, their associated side effects, and providing alternative medications with potentially fewer adverse effects. This project leverages machine learning and data science techniques to suggest alternative drugs based on effectiveness and safety considerations.

## Project Objective
The main objectives of this project include:
- Creating a structured dataset of drugs and their reported side effects.
- Analyzing patterns in side effects to identify high-risk medications.
- Recommending alternative drugs with fewer or less severe side effects.
- Implementing a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and patients to explore medication options.

## Features
- **Drug and Side Effects Database**: Comprehensive dataset linking drugs with their side effects.
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Machine learning-based recommendations for alternative drugs.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to depict drug safety profiles.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific drugs and their alternatives.
- **API Support**: Integration with healthcare applications and services.

## Data Sources
- Publicly available medical datasets (e.g., FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), DrugBank, PubMed).
- Open-source pharmaceutical research papers.
- Crowdsourced patient reviews and feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Frameworks**: Flask / FastAPI (for API development)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Seaborn

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drugs_and_side_effects.git
   cd drugs_and_side_effects
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   python setup_database.py
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Search for a drug**: Enter the drug name to view side effects.
- **Explore alternatives**: View suggested medications with fewer side effects.
- **Data visualization**: Analyze drug safety through charts and reports.
- **API Access**: Integrate the system into healthcare platforms.
